```

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Clone/Download** the portfolio files to your web server directory
2. **Add Images**: Place your profile pictures in the `images/` folder:
   - `profile1.jpg` (default)
   - `profile2.jpg`
   - `profile3.jpg` 
   - `profile4.jpg`
3. **Customize Content**: Edit `index.html` to update your personal information
4. **Update Lab Links**: Replace placeholder lab URLs in the research project cards
5. **Adjust Colors**: Modify CSS variables in `styles.css` for color customization
6. **Deploy**: Upload to your web hosting service

## üé® Customization Guide

### **Color Scheme**
Edit CSS variables in `styles.css`:
```css
:root {
    --neural-blue: #4FC3F7;        /* Primary neural accent */
    --neural-cyan: #00E5FF;        /* Highlight color */
    --neural-purple: #9C27B0;      /* Secondary accent */
    --bg-primary: #1a1a1a;         /* Main background */
    --surface-primary: #2d2d2d;    /* Card backgrounds */
}
```

### **Neural Network Density**
Adjust node count in `script.js`:
```javascript
this.nodeCount = window.innerWidth > 768 ? 30 : 15;  // Desktop : Mobile
this.connectionCount = window.innerWidth > 768 ? 20 : 10;
```

### **Cascade Effect Intensity**
Modify cascade phases in `script.js`:
```javascript
// Phase 1: High-energy burst (0-1 seconds)
this.fireCascadePhase(12, 100, this.getVibriantColors(), 3);
```

### **Life Dimensions**
Update the About Me cards in `index.html`:
```html

    
        
    
    Your Dimension

```

## üß™ Interactive Features

```html

Content
```

### **Contact Card Layout**
```css
/* Adjust contact grid for different layouts */
.contact-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); /* 2x2 grid */
    max-width: 800px;
}
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Neural Network Not Appearing**
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure SVG support is enabled
- Verify all CSS and JS files are loading properly

### **Images Not Loading**
- Verify image files are in the correct `/images/` directory
- Check file names match exactly (`profile1.jpg`, etc.)
- Ensure proper file permissions and web server configuration

### **Animations Too Intensive**
- Press `Esc` key to toggle reduced motion mode
- The system auto-detects low-end devices and adapts accordingly
- Check browser's motion preferences settings

### **Cascade Effect Not Working**
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled and not blocked
- Check for console errors in browser developer tools
- Try clicking in different areas of the background
